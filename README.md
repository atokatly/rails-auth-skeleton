# README

This is a simple rails skeleton using Bcrypt for authorizations. 

## Getting Started

If you want to clone down the repo, feel free to do so.  

You will also need to bundle your gems if you wish to look at the project on localhost:
    
    bundle install

Once you run the server you will have the ability to create users using Bcrypt for authorizations.
